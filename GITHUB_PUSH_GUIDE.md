## üîß Complete the GitHub Push (2 Methods)

### Method 1: Create New Repository on GitHub (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `MarkIT` (exactly as you specified)
3. Description: `Full-Stack Student Attendance Tracker - All 10 FSD Experiments Implemented`
4. **Keep it PUBLIC** (or choose Private if you prefer)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. **DO NOT** add .gitignore (we already have one)
7. **DO NOT** add license yet
8. Click **"Create repository"**

#### Step 2: Get Your GitHub Username
Your GitHub URL will be: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MarkIT`

For example, if your username is `siddh123`, it would be:
`https://github.com/siddh123/MarkIT`

#### Step 3: Add Remote and Push

Open your terminal in the MarkIt folder and run these commands:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MarkIT.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**If prompted for credentials**:
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: Use a **Personal Access Token** (not your password)

### Method 2: Use GitHub Desktop (Easier)

#### Step 1: Download GitHub Desktop
1. Go to: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Download and install

#### Step 2: Publish Repository
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. File ‚Üí Add Local Repository
3. Browse to: `C:\Users\siddh\Desktop\MarkIt`
4. Click "Add Repository"
5. Click "Publish repository" button
6. Name: `MarkIT`
7. Description: `Full-Stack Student Attendance Tracker`
8. Uncheck "Keep this code private" (or keep checked if you want it private)
9. Click "Publish repository"

‚úÖ **Done!** Your project is now on GitHub!

   - ‚úÖ `repo` (full control)
   - ‚úÖ `workflow` (for GitHub Actions)
6. Click "Generate token"
7. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)
8. Use this token as your password when pushing

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Error: "remote origin already exists"
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MarkIT.git
```

### Error: "authentication failed"
- Use Personal Access Token instead of password
